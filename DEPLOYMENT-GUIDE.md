# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

This guide will help you troubleshoot common issues when deploying this Next.js application on Vercel.

## Common Deployment Issues and Solutions

### 1. Build Failures

#### Environment Variables Missing
- **Issue**: Build fails because environment variables are not configured.
- **Solution**: Configure all required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
  - Go to your project on Vercel
  - Navigate to "Settings" > "Environment Variables"
  - Add all variables from the `.env.example` file

#### Node.js Version Mismatch
- **Issue**: Build fails because the Node.js version is incompatible.
- **Solution**: Set the correct Node.js version in Vercel:
  - Go to "Settings" > "General" > "Node.js Version"
  - Set it to 18.x (or latest LTS)
  - A `.nvmrc` file is included to specify Node.js 18

#### Dependency Resolution Issues
- **Issue**: "Module not found" or other dependency errors.
- **Solution**: Clear build cache and redeploy:
  - Go to "Settings" > "General" > "Build & Development Settings"
  - Click "Clear Build Cache and Deploy"

### 2. Runtime Errors

#### MongoDB Connection Issues
- **Issue**: Application shows "Error connecting to database".
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify your MongoDB URI in Vercel environment variables
  - Ensure your MongoDB instance is accessible from Vercel (check IP whitelisting)
  - Enable "Network Access" to allow connections from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) in MongoDB Atlas

#### NextAuth Configuration
- **Issue**: Authentication doesn't work in production.
- **Solution**: 
  - Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set to your production URL
  - Verify `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is correctly set
  - Check that callbacks in NextAuth configuration are compatible with the deployed environment

#### Image Optimization Issues
- **Issue**: Images fail to load or optimize.
- **Solution**:
  - Make sure image domains are configured in `next.config.ts`
  - Verify Cloudinary credentials if you're using Cloudinary for images

### 3. Performance Issues

#### Slow First Load
- **Issue**: Initial page load is slow.
- **Solution**: 
  - Check if you're using proper data fetching methods for your use case
  - Consider implementing ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for frequently accessed pages
  - Use proper caching headers

#### Punycode Warning
- **Issue**: Warning about punycode during build.
- **Solution**: This is a known issue with dependencies and can be safely ignored.

## Verifying Deployment Success

After deployment, you should:

1. Test all main application features
2. Verify authentication flows work correctly
3. Check that API routes respond as expected
4. Confirm MongoDB connection works properly
5. Test Cloudinary image uploads if applicable
